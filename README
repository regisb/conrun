conrun.py
---------

This is a very basic, yet extremely useful script that allows you to continuously run any given command. I use it for test-driven development and continuous building.

Install:

    sudo ln -s $(pwd)/conrun.py /usr/bin/conrun

This is how I typically run it, provided I have a Makefile project with a
unittest target that builds all unit tests:

    conrun "make unittests && ./unittests"
